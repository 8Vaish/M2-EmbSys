- **1. Arduino:**
  - Arduino Uno Board is used for Fast processing and easy interface. Arduino is used as an interfacing device for 4×4 matrix keypad, relay module, 16×2 LCD display. In Arduino is loaded with the help of IDE software. Arduino is user-friendly as it provides user an easy option to edit the program that is to be loaded in Arduino.

- **2. Relay Module:**
  - Relay Module is used as electrically operated switch. It close and open the electric supply on the basis of commands given by Arduino. The S terminal of relay module is connected to Arduino and positive and negative pin are connected 16×2 LCD Display. And another two pins are connected to supply and load respectively.

- **3. 4×4 Keypad matrix:**
   - In this project, the 4×4 keypad matrix is used for entering the password. The password entered in 4×4 keypad matrix is used as input for Arduino to verify it. The 4×4 keypad matrix is connected to Arduino with help of connecting wires to pin 2 to pin 9

-  **4.16×2 LCD display:**
    - LCD display is used to give required instruction to the operator. It displays the status of password whether it is correct or incorrect.

- **5.Transistiors:**
      - Transistor is used as a switch. Three pins, the emitter and collector and base. Current flows in through the collector and out of the emitter. By modulating the base pin, you can control whether current is permitted to flow. When a sufficiently high voltage is applied to the base, current is allowed to flow through the transistor.
- **6.Rectifier:**
     -A rectifier used is for conversation of an Alternating current input into a direct current output. Arrangement of 4 diodes forming a bridge rectifier that delivers pulsating DC. It
